# Week 1 – Python Foundations & Tooling  
**AI Pros Bootcamp**

This directory contains all materials for **Week 1** of the AI Pros Bootcamp.  
The focus of this week is building **strong Python foundations**, learning **professional tooling**, and completing a **small end-to-end project** that mirrors real-world AI/engineering workflows.

By the end of this week, you should be comfortable writing structured Python code, using files and modules, working with Git, and building a simple interactive app.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:

- Write clean, readable Python code
- Organize code into functions, modules, and classes
- Work confidently with files and structured data
- Use Git for version control
- Build a basic Streamlit app
- Package and document a small project professionally

---

## ✅ Outcome

By the end of this week, you will deliver a fully working Python project that can be run from the command line, launched as a Streamlit app, and shared via Git with clear documentation. This project establishes professional coding habits that will be reused throughout the bootcamp.

Week 1 sets the foundation for the rest of the bootcamp.  
Everything that follows—data science, machine learning, and AI systems—assumes comfort with the tools and practices introduced here.

**Take your time. Build it right.**
