# Week 2 – Data Foundations & Exploratory Analysis  
**AI Pros Bootcamp**

This directory contains all materials for **Week 2** of the AI Pros Bootcamp.  
The focus of this week is developing **professional data handling skills**—from raw data ingestion to clean, well-documented datasets ready for modeling.

Week 2 emphasizes **thinking like a data professional**, not just writing code. You will learn how to assess data quality, clean and transform datasets, explore patterns visually, and prepare data pipelines that can be handed off confidently to downstream teams.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

- Think systematically about data workflows
- Assess and improve data quality
- Clean and transform real-world datasets
- Handle dates, times, and outliers correctly
- Perform effective exploratory data analysis
- Produce clean, documented datasets ready for modeling

---

## ✅ Outcome

By the end of Week 2, you will produce a reproducible data pipeline and a final dataset that can be confidently handed off for modeling. Your deliverables will demonstrate not just technical cleaning skills, but clear reasoning, documentation, and professional data judgment.

Week 2 ensures you can be trusted with data.

After this week, you should be able to hand a dataset to a teammate and say:

> “This data is clean, documented, and ready to use.”

These skills form the backbone of all machine learning and AI systems that follow.
